# APS Failure at Scania Trucks

The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the Air 
Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, such as 
braking and gear changes. We are asked to predict if there is truck APS failure based on the sensor telemetry data. 
Predicting failures before they happen can save us thousands of dollars and customers trust.
